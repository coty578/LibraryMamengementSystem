# LibraryMamengementSystem
Project Description:
The Library Management System is a computer-based application created to help manage library activites in an easy and organized way.
The system is designed to replace the manual method of recording books and students, which is slow and can cause errors.
This project allows the librarian to store and manage information about books, students, and borrowing records.
The librarian can add new books, update boo details, register students, issue books, return books, and search for records quickly.
The system is developed using C# Windows Forms for the user interface and SQL Server for the database.
All data is stored securely in the database, which helps keep records accurate and well organized.
The main purpose of this project is to save time, reduce paperwork, and improve the efficiency of library management.
It also helps in tracking book availability and borrowing history.
This Library Management System is suitable for schools and small libraries and provides a simple, user-friendly solution for daily library operatios.
